Setup vim to use GNU global for auto completion.

Prerequistes:

1. GNU global
2. AutoCompPop plugin

Setup:

Copy functions from vimrc_gtags_completion into your vimrc file.
The omnifunc will provide completion based on gtags and SuperCleverTab helps when AutoCompPop entries are not the one you are looking for.

Usage:

AutoCompPop provides completion as you type and in case none of them make sense, just press <TAB> and you will get gtags based completion. It's that simple.
